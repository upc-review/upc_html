            <h5 class="card-title">Problem Summary</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Users face difficulties in effectively managing their privacy settings when sharing content online, leading to potential privacy breaches. The texts and images shared online often contain sensitive personal information, and default or poorly configured privacy settings can inadvertently expose this information. These difficulties stem from the complexity of privacy settings and the sheer volume of content shared online, necessitating greater user awareness and understanding of privacy implications. Manually configuring privacy settings for each piece of shared content, whether text-based posts or images, is challenging. Current systems are inadequate in providing personalised, dynamic privacy management solutions that align with users' evolving privacy needs and preferences.
            </p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Rationale</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Automating privacy settings recommendations aims to enhance user privacy protection, reduce the risk of accidental data exposure, and alleviate the burden on users to understand and navigate complex privacy settings interfaces.
            </p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Solution</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The development of advanced, user-friendly systems leveraging machine learning, data mining, and semantic analysis to predict and recommend personalised privacy settings for users.

<br><br>
Chen et al. <a href="GD14.html#section1">[1]</a> proposed a model to predict and recommend privacy settings for text-based social media posts using a multi-class classifier and crowdsourcing. The solution analyses historical posts, social context, and keywords to recommend privacy settings. For new users or those with insufficient data (cold-start problem), it integrates crowdsourcing with machine learning, utilising data from other users to predict privacy settings. 
<br><br>
Nakamura et al. <a href="GD14.html#section2">[2]</a>  proposal is a prediction engine for default privacy settings using Support Vector Machines (SVM) based on minimal user information at registration.
The solution utilises user attributes like age, gender, and type of mobile phone to predict optimal privacy settings, improving user experience during account setup.
<br><br>
Rosni et al. <a href="GD14.html#section3">[3]</a>  proposed a system using Factorization Machines (FMs) to model and predict user consent preferences for LinkedIn accounts. The solution predicts privacy settings based on user attributes and behaviours, reducing consent fatigue and improving privacy management.
<br><br>
Orekondy, Schiele, Fritz <a href="GD14.html#section4">[4]</a> proposed a Visual Privacy Advisor, a system to predict privacy risks in images shared on social media using machine learning models. The solution provides privacy risk scores for images based on privacy-sensitive attributes, helping users manage visual content privacy. The solution employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2647868.2654889" target="_blank">CaffeNet</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298594" target="_blank">GoogleNet</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2016.90" target="_blank">ResNet-50</a> to predict privacy attributes from images, utilising a multi-label classification approach. The approach is validated through a user study that assesses the alignment between users' privacy preferences and the model's privacy risk predictions, aiming to provide personalised privacy risk assessments for images. This technical framework underpins the development of a Visual Privacy Advisor that helps users manage their visual privacy based on personalised privacy preferences. The dataset and other materials are available at <a href="https://tribhuvanesh.github.io/vpa/" target="_blank">https://tribhuvanesh.github.io/vpa/</a>.
<br><br>
Lee and Kobsa <a href="GD14.html#section5">[5]</a> focused on privacy preference prediction in IoT, proposing a model for predicting user privacy preferences using contextual factors and clustering.
The solution utilises factors like location, monitoring entity, and purpose to provide personalised privacy recommendations for IoT devices. 

<br><br>
Squicciarini et al. <a href="GD14.html#section6">[6]</a> presented an Adaptive Privacy Policy Prediction (A3P) system for images on social media. The system uses image content, metadata, and social context to generate personalised privacy policies automatically. When a user uploads an image, A3P first classifies the image using content and metadata, then predicts a privacy policy using historical data. If the user lacks history or exhibits changes in privacy preferences, A3P consults social context to align recommendations with similar users' practices. This dual approach ensures tailored privacy settings, addressing individual preferences and evolving social dynamics, simplifying privacy management in complex social media environments.
<br><br>
Albertini, Carminati and Ferrari <a href="GD14.html#section7">[7]</a> focused on a recommender system for privacy settings in social networks that uses relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC) and association rules mining.
The system analyses user behaviour and relationship data to recommend personalised access control policies. It dynamically suggests access control policies when new resources are uploaded, using learned associations to predict the most appropriate privacy settings. This model aims to alleviate the complexity of manually setting privacy policies by providing automated, context-sensitive recommendations tailored to individual user habits and preferences.

<br><br>

Squicciarini et al. <a href="GD14.html#section8">[8]</a> presented a tag-driven policy recommender for image sharing on social networks. The solution analyses image tags to correlate with privacy preferences, offering personalised recommendations based on tag semantics and co-presence. For new images with unfamiliar tags, T2P employs a cold-start approach using semantic analysis to recommend privacy settings, ensuring relevance even when historical data is lacking.

<br><br>
Mondal et al. <a href="GD14.html#section9">[9]</a> proposed a Semi-Automated Privacy Management to update outdated privacy settings on social media, particularly Facebook, using user studies and machine learning.
The system identifies and corrects potentially incorrect privacy settings based on user interactions and dynamic behaviour. The study considered the longitudinal aspect of privacy management, highlighting the challenges users face in maintaining appropriate privacy settings as their life circumstances and social networks evolve.
<br><br>

Sanchez et al. <a href="GD14.html#section10">[10]</a> first defined a data model of privacy preferences for the fitness domain using the PPIoT ontology (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.10.024" target="_blank">Privacy Preference for IoT Ontology</a>). This model includes permissions based on the most popular fitness trackers and GDPR requirements. They used a crowdsourced dataset to identify privacy profiles via machine learning clustering algorithms. They also developed a tree-based classifier to recommend privacy profiles based on user traits, such as privacy attitudes, social behaviour, and demographics. The recommendation strategies were integrated into a personal data manager framework, aiming to simplify privacy settings while maintaining GDPR compliance and user control over their preferences.
<br><br>

Kelley et al. <a href="GD14.html#section11">[11]</a> presented an incremental policy learning approach where users provide feedback to refine privacy settings. The solution uses user feedback to improve privacy policies incrementally, ensuring settings align with user preferences. A key component is the neighbourhood search mechanism, which explores close variations of the current policy to suggest incremental improvements. These suggestions are then presented to the user, who decides which, if any, to accept, ensuring the user's control over the policy evolution. This approach combines machine learning with user insight by allowing users to interact directly with and refine their preferences based on system suggestions, offering a tailored and user-friendly method for managing privacy settings. To demonstrate the approach's effectiveness, they developed a prototype application called PeopleFinder, in which users share their locations with others based on refined privacy configurations.
<br><br>

Misra and Such <a href="GD14.html#section12">[12]</a> proposed PACMAN, an agent that recommends personalised access control decisions on social media based on social context and network structure.
The agent analyses relationships and content to make dynamic privacy recommendations, ensuring settings match user interactions.
<br><br>
Munemasa and Iwaihara <a href="GD14.html#section13">[13]</a> employed a recommendation system for social networking services using trend analysis and privacy scores.
The solution uses privacy settings data and user trends to provide personalised privacy recommendations, helping users understand common privacy practices. These recommendations are visualised on the user's SNS privacy settings page, aiding users in adjusting their settings based on the analysis of large-scale user data and specific attribute co-occurrences, ultimately helping users manage their online privacy better.
<br><br>
Villarán and Beltrán <a href="GD14.html#section14">[14]</a> proposed a Privacy Advisor for federated identity systems that would provide personalised recommendations to assist users in managing privacy settings.
The solution provides real-time, personalised privacy advice based on user profiles and service provider practices, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR.

<br><br>
Shanmugarasa et al. <a href="GD14.html#section15">[15]</a> presents a Privacy Preference Recommender System (PPRS) designed for smart home environments, integrating Personal Data Stores (PDSs) to assist users in making data-sharing decisions.
The PPRS uses machine learning models to recommend privacy settings dynamically based on contextual factors and user preferences. The system operates within the PDS architecture, ensuring that all data processing and analytics remain under the user’s control. It automates privacy decisions by suggesting appropriate actions for data-sharing requests, reducing the burden on users to configure their privacy settings manually.
<br><br>
Bernsmed. Tøndel and Nyre <a href="GD14.html#section16">[16]</a> presents the Privacy Advisor, a software tool that uses Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to assist users in making informed privacy decisions by providing personalised recommendations based on past experiences. The Privacy Advisor retrieves and adapts solutions from similar past cases to recommend privacy settings. It learns from user feedback to improve future recommendations, ensuring that privacy policies align with users' preferences and contexts.
<br><br>
Bilogrevic et al <a href="GD14.html#section17">[17]</a> propose the Smart Privacy-aware Information Sharing Mechanism (SPISM), which uses machine-learning techniques to make semi-automatic decisions about whether to share information and at what level of detail. This system adapts to each user's behaviour and predicts the level of detail for each sharing decision based on personal and contextual features.
By learning from user behaviours and preferences over time, SPISM offers personalised recommendations for information sharing, ensuring that the recommendations align with individual privacy preferences and contexts.
<br><br>
Alom et al. <a href="GD14.html#section18">[18]</a> proposed two innovative techniques: Knapsack Privacy Checking (KPC) and Knapsack Graph-Based Privacy Checking (KPC-G). These techniques frame the privacy-checking problem as a knapsack problem, optimising the selection of services based on user-specified privacy preferences and tolerance levels.
The KPC method matches services to user preferences based on a preset tolerance level. In contrast, the KPC-G method dynamically adjusts these tolerance values by leveraging a similarity graph of user privacy preferences. The latter maximises user satisfaction by suggesting services that balance privacy concerns with benefits. 
<br><br>
Couto and Zorzo <a href="GD14.html#section19">[19]</a> present a privacy negotiation mechanism for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The proposed mechanism mediates the exchange of information between data producers (users) and data consumers (services), allowing users to control their data disclosure more effectively. The mechanism leverages a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to predict user privacy preferences, enabling automatic responses to data requests based on learned patterns. Users can set a confidence level for these predictions, ensuring the mechanism's responses align with their privacy expectations.<br><br>
Filipczuk et al. <a href="GD14.html#section20">[20]</a> propose an innovative agent-based negotiation framework to manage privacy permissions between users and service providers. This framework leverages a multi-issue alternating-offer protocol that accommodates partial and complete offers, aiming to automate privacy negotiations and reduce user burden. The framework uses autonomous agents to negotiate on behalf of users, presenting a potential agreement that the user can accept, override, or continue to negotiate. It introduces methods for implicitly learning user preferences through feedback on offers, either by accepting or rejecting them.
<br><br>
VeilMe <a href="GD14.html#section21">[21]</a> aims to reduce user effort in configuring privacy settings by offering initial privacy recommendations based on rule-based and prediction-based approaches. 
These initial settings aim to reduce the user’s efforts in adjusting the complex privacy configurations by providing a reasonable starting point tailored to the user’s personality and common sharing preferences​.

                    <li>Systems like the Privacy Advisor <a href="GD14.html#section16">[16]</a> and those employing human-in-the-loop approaches <a href="GD14.html#section9">[9]</a> emphasise the importance of user-centred design by keeping users in control and making privacy decisions less mentally demanding. They effectively communicate privacy settings through visualisations and recommendation messages validated through field studies and user feedback <a href="GD14.html#section13">[13]</a><a href="GD14.html#section14">[14]</a>. Extending privacy settings to visual content <a href="GD14.html#section4">[4]</a> and leveraging AI for scalable, automatic text analysis demonstrate advancements in privacy management tools <a href="GD14.html#section7">[7]</a>, outperforming human judgment in identifying privacy risks. The simplicity and generalisability of privacy profiles <a href="GD14.html#section10">[10]</a> and incremental policy suggestions <a href="GD14.html#section14">[14]</a> facilitate user understanding and decision-making, aligning privacy choices with user preferences and contexts. These approaches underscore the systems' ability to adapt to changing user needs and improve the relevance and effectiveness of privacy policies over time.</li>
                
            
                
                    <li>Many proposals effectively address the cold start problem by leveraging machine learning, crowdsourcing, and contextual information to recommend privacy policies for new users. These systems, such as T2P <a href="GD14.html#section8">[8]</a> and A3P <a href="GD14.html#section6">[6]</a>, show promising results without prior user data, providing utility across various scenarios. They incorporate user feedback to refine recommendations, enhancing accuracy over time. The use of diverse datasets and human evaluators, as seen in the studies <a href="GD14.html#section4">[4]</a><a href="GD14.html#section7">[7]</a>, adds real-world applicability, demonstrating significant potential for practical implementation in online social networks and other platforms. These systems' adaptability and multifaceted feature selection, combining text, sentiment, and keyword analysis <a href="GD14.html#section1">[1]</a>, enhance their performance and align well with user expectations and privacy preferences.</li>
                
            
                
            
                
                    <li>The various proposed solutions demonstrated high accuracy and effectiveness in predicting and managing user privacy preferences across different contexts and platforms. PACMAN <a href="GD14.html#section12">[12]</a> achieves an average accuracy of 91.8% by considering relationship types and content information and making precise access control recommendations for social media. The consent recommender system <a href="GD14.html#section3">[3]</a> shows an accuracy of 87% for users with no prior data, performing even better for users with existing data. Decision tree models achieve 77% accuracy in predicting privacy decisions for IoT scenarios <a href="GD14.html#section5">[5]</a>, while the PPRS <a href="GD14.html#section15">[15]</a> reaches 92.62% accuracy in data-sharing decisions, effectively addressing the cold start problem. SPISM <a href="GD14.html#section17">[17]</a> outperforms individual privacy policies, achieving up to 90% correct sharing decisions with limited user setup. The KPC-G <a href="GD14.html#section18">[18]</a> model and other mechanisms <a href="GD14.html#section19">[19]</a> show high satisfaction and accuracy rates (up to 88%), validating their effectiveness in aligning user privacy choices with their preferences and reducing the mental demand of decision-making processes.</li>

                    <li>Several proposals encounter scalability issues and difficulties in accounting for user-specific differences. For example, the A3P-Social <a href="GD14.html#section6">[6]</a> component's complexity and cost pose challenges for efficient implementation, and systems like PACMAN <a href="GD14.html#section12">[12]</a> may not fully represent the complexity of social relationships. Furthermore, one-size-fits-all approaches may not satisfy unique privacy needs <a href="GD14.html#section8">[8]</a>, and reliance on user-supplied content information can limit effectiveness in scenarios lacking sufficient metadata <a href="GD14.html#section12">[12]</a>. Over-reliance on technology for privacy management could lead to user complacency, potentially overlooking non-visual privacy risks <a href="GD14.html#section4">[4]</a> or user's capacity to review suggestions might decrease as the complexity and number of policies and configurations grow <a href="GD14.html#section11">[11]</a>. Additionally, advanced privacy management tools often require significant computational resources and technical knowledge, which could limit accessibility for average users or small-scale platforms <a href="GD14.html#section4">[4]</a>.</li>
                
            
                
                    <li>Many of the proposals face challenges in model adaptability and user experience. For instance, while combining text, sentiment, and keyword features achieves high prediction accuracy, it may limit adaptability to posts with less indicative features <a href="GD14.html#section1">[1]</a>. Similarly, although effective for new users, global classifiers do not match personalised classifiers' performance, highlighting room for improvement in handling new user data <a href="GD14.html#section1">[1]</a>. Systems also struggle with real-world applicability due to biases in participant demographics and expertise, survey scenarios, assumptions about the availability of dynamic features on mobile phones, and specific web applications scenarios <a href="GD14.html#section3">[3]</a><a href="GD14.html#section5">[5]</a><a href="GD14.html#section9">[9]</a><a href="GD14.html#section10">[10]</a><a href="GD14.html#section11">[11]</a><a href="GD14.html#section13">[13]</a><a href="GD14.html#section14">[14]</a><a href="GD14.html#section15">[15]</a><a href="GD14.html#section16">[16]</a>.</li>
